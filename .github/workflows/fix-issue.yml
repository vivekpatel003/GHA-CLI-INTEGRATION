              You are fixing failing CI tests in this repo.

              Steps:
              1) Read ./test.log to identify the failing test(s) and root cause.
              2) Make the minimal change to fix the failure.
              3) Run `npm test` to confirm green.
              4) Create a new branch, commit, and open a *draft PR* describing the fix.

              Notes:
              - The test output is in ./test.log
